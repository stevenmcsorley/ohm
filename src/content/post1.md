# Experimenting with Redis and WebSockets for Real-Time IoT Data Streaming

In the realm of software engineering, depth in understanding technical decisions is crucial. To explore the potential of Redis and WebSockets for streaming real-time data from IoT devices to a frontend application, I embarked on an in-depth experiment...

## The Stack

- **Docker**: To containerize the services and manage dependencies.
- **Traefik**: For reverse proxying and load balancing.
- **Redis**: As the message broker to handle data from IoT devices.
- **WebSockets**: To provide real-time communication between the server and the client.
- **Express.js**: For setting up the backend server.
- **React**: For building the frontend application.
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: For monitoring and visualization.
