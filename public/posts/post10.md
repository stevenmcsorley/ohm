Agile methodologies are often misunderstood and misused. They are not a silver bullet for all development challenges. Misapplying Agile can lead to chaos and inefficiencies.

## Common Misconceptions

- **"Agile means no documentation."**: Agile values working software over comprehensive documentation, not the absence of it.
- **"Agile means no planning."**: Agile involves continuous planning and adaptation, not a lack of planning.

## Misuses of Agile

- **Lack of Structure**: Failing to implement necessary structure and discipline can lead to chaos.
- **Ignoring Principles**: Misapplying Agile principles leads to ineffective processes.

## Conclusion

Agile methodologies require proper understanding and application. They are tools, not solutions in themselves.
