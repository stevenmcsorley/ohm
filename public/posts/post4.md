In this article, we will dive into the powerful world of Docker and Kubernetes. These tools have revolutionized the way we deploy and manage applications.

## Introduction to Docker

Docker is a platform that allows developers to create, deploy, and run applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and ensure that the application runs consistently across different environments.

## Introduction to Kubernetes

Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s, is an open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## Docker and Kubernetes in Action

To demonstrate how Docker and Kubernetes work together, let's take a look at a sample deployment.

### Docker Container

Here's an example of a simple Docker container:

\`\`\`dockerfile
FROM node:14
WORKDIR /app
COPY package\*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
\`\`\`

### Kubernetes Deployment

And here's how you can deploy the Docker container using Kubernetes:

\`\`\`yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
name: example-deployment
spec:
replicas: 3
selector:
matchLabels:
app: example
template:
metadata:
labels:
app: example
spec:
containers: - name: example-container
image: example-image:latest
ports: - containerPort: 3000
\`\`\`
