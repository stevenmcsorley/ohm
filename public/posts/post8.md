- **Maintainability**: Facilitates easier maintenance and debugging.

## Common Excuses and Rebuttals

- **"It's too restrictive."**: Standards provide a framework, not a restriction. They ensure quality.
- **"We don't have time."**: Following standards saves time in the long run by reducing maintenance efforts.
