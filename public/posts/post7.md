Overengineering is a common pitfall in software development. Adding unnecessary complexity can lead to increased costs, longer development times, and maintainability issues. Simple solutions are often more effective and efficient.

## The Pitfalls of Overengineering

- **Increased Costs**: More complex systems require more resources to develop and maintain.
- **Longer Development Times**: Complexity slows down the development process.
- **Maintainability Issues**: Complex systems are harder to understand and maintain.

## The Benefits of Simplicity

- **Cost Efficiency**: Simple solutions are cheaper to develop and maintain.
- **Speed**: Development is faster with fewer complexities.
- **Maintainability**: Simpler systems are easier to understand and maintain.

## Conclusion

Avoid overengineering by focusing on simplicity. Simple solutions are often more effective and sustainable in the long run.
